                          href="http://mail.greyfox.ai/">mail.Qubriux.ai</a>’ domain to customers. Sending from a
                        dedicated domain improves the likelihood of landing in the inbox and building domain reputation.

Choose the date to stop recurring it infinitely Canvas area where Trigger block is added to get you started Setting up the Trigger A trigger marks the starting point of your campaign. A trigger can be based on an event or on time or a combination of both. The conditions can be accessed by clicking on ‘Add New Condition’ on the right pop-up panel. The following events can be used to enroll customers in the campaign: Time-based strategy Adds an item to the cart Begins Checkout Places an order Views a Product Searches for a Product After they perform the specific event, they get enrolled for going ahead in the workflow. You can select Date Range or Specific Date as per your campaign’s need. It also allows you to choose specific time intervals and a specific combination of days when you want this campaign to be live. If you want the campaign live on all days and at all times you just need to switch on the toggle button in front of both the options. Within a trigger, you can create multiple groups of conditions and add conditions within a group.  Click on Save once you are with the trigger configuration. You can create a trigger just based on the date and time. For. ex if you wish to run a new year campaign and reach out to your customers, you can create a trigger based on the date and then reach out. For this, choose Time Based Strategy from the list of triggers and configure the date and time. In this case, you can’t add a group of conditions. How to add more blocks? Once you add a trigger block on the canvas, it will have a plus sign at the bottom attached to it. Click on that to open a list of elements that could be added to the workflow. The list of the elements are Add If/Else Branch If/Else Branch Add Time Delay Send Email Send SMS Send Offer Send Survey You can add multiple blocks one after the another or in between by clicking on the plus icon. Adding an if/else Branch block Adding an if/else branch creates two distinct customizable parallel paths in your strategy. You can use branching to reach out to your customers in different ways. If the branching condition holds true, eligible customers follow the Yes path, and the rest of the customers follow the No path. You can choose the time in days, hours and minutes within which you wish the event should happen. To continue the flow, you can add blocks on the Yes and No path as per your campaign strategy Adding Time Delay block Adding a delay creates a waiting period between the previous block and the next block. You can set a delay of days, hours, minutes, or any combination of these. If blocks are back-to-back without delay, then they occur sequentially without any wait if they qualify. Adding Send Email block Email block helps to attach an Email during the workflow to engage with your customers. You can choose from existing email templates or create a new one. To send an Email, you need to input the Email Subject and choose the Email template. You can choose from pre-created templates by clicking on Attach Template or create a new one from scratch by clicking on Create new template button. Click on Save to attach the template. You can review the template by clicking on the template name and edit again if required. Adding Send SMS block (available only in India) SMS is another channel to engage with your customers.

The offers which are in Draft status and have email or SMS template attached will be visible here. You can browse through the list of offers and click on ‘View Summary’ to refer to it. In one click you can attach an offer and add it to your campaign. Right now, you can only add pre-curated offers, which can be created by navigating to the offer screen.

                    "content": "  Want to make your customer engagements more exciting?  Do you want to get away from usual emails and SMS as a reach-out channel? Do you wish to engage in real-time with customers and get to know what they like? Or are you worried about your bottom line every time you roll out an offer? If you seek all these then you are at the right place. Qubriux has created a game that your customer can play when they come to your website. Gamify creates a win-win condition for you and your customers. During the game, Qubriux’s advanced data science capabilities show those products to the customers for which they have high intent to buy. Based on every action, the game learns and suggests products adjusting to their likes and dislikes. Customers get to choose the products which they want and you give discounts on those products which are optimal to make more purchases. The game is launched as a widget on your online store page. It is a pop-over widget present on the right-side bottom of the screen visible to the customer to launch with a click of a button. A user can click on the widget button and start playing the game straight away. Gamify Gamify is launched when your eligible customer visits your online store. The objective is to engage with the customer in real-time, recommend similar products which they have bought in the past, shown interest recently and also the products which they may buy. The game is divided into hurdles and in every hurdle, few offers are shown. The customer will be eligible for the offers when he/she has finished the game. To finish a game, they have to choose one product from each hurdle. For the options shown in every hurdle, they can either like or dislike. Liking a product means they have accepted that offer and they will advance to the next stage. Disliking means they don’t like that particular offer and they will be shown more offers. Components of the game The game has multiple hurdles that a customer has to complete in a bounded time frame. Successful completion of the game is measured if the customer is able to play through all the hurdles, from first till the end. Any other scenarios, of the customer not playing till the ultimate hurdle or quitting the game in-between, or timing out for the provided game session is also considered as a lost iteration of the game or unsuccessful termination of the game. Hurdle: The game has a finite, greater than 1, number of hurdles defined. The player is supposed to play all these hurdles, one after the other in order to finish the game and claim a reward. Every hurdle consists of product offers to choose from, which is a reward presented to the user Products per hurdle: Every hurdle has a fixed number of products to be shown. Every hurdle has a reward-associated product offer customized for every player uniquely to increase the ultimate objective of the game Time per Offer: Each offer has an associated timer, the customer either choose that currently active offer within the defined timer, or the next offer is shown automatically on timeout Game timer: This timer defines the total time a player has to complete all the hurdles of the game in order to successfully finish the game. A failure to complete all the hurdles within the defined time leads to an unsuccessful game session post which a customer is not eligible to claim any partial reward from the game Game reward: The final bag of rewards is presented to the player based on the selections made through the hurdles of the game, in a successful iteration of the game reward. It is communicated to the customer at the end of the game and notified through email Who can play this game? You get to choose your customers to whom this game will be shown. The customers who have an account on your store and are eligible to play will be shown this game if they have spent 30 seconds on the website. What benefit do I get? or Why should I use Gamify? The capability gamifies your customer engagement. When a game is launched, Qubriux’s AI recommends personalized offers to each customer based on their past purchase, recent store activity, and their likelihood to buy an item. The discount that is given on each product is also optimized based on the customer purchasing behavior. This way, instead of giving 20% off to every customer, you can go a step ahead and use Qubriux to give an appropriate discount to every customer on which they can buy. This saves additional margin for you which you would have spent while rolling out generic offers. How to configure the game? Or how does this game work?

The Delete button for them will always remain Deactivated. Suppression List A suppression list includes all the email addresses of all the users who have opted out of your email campaigns by clicking on unsubscribe or marking your email as spam. Those contacts are added to the suppression list. Why is a Suppression List required? Each time you send an email campaign, Qubriux compares recipients' email addresses with those on the suppression list. If email addresses match the addresses on the suppression list, the email won’t be sent to those particular addresses. This means that you won’t accidentally or intentionally send any email to users who have opted out. Otherwise, universal email providers are more likely to bounce your emails hard, and you would have a hard time delivering your marketing messages in the future.  Managing your suppression list In Qubriux, you can either use Qubriux’s delivery domain or add your own domain. The suppression list can be found on the left panel under My customers. Here you can see all the contact who have unsubscribed to your emails. Based on specific requests, you can manually add any contact to this list or remove any contact so that they can start receiving communication again. Adding a contact to Suppression List To add a contact to the Suppression list, you can click on ‘Add New Contact’ and then input the email address. Once a contact is added to the list, then for that domain, this contact will not be sent emails Removing a contact from Suppression List You can not remove a contact from the suppression list. The contacts are in the suppression list because either they did not provide their consent to receive emails or they have unsubscribed from your emails.

That is why Qubriux has powerful Survey and NLP (Natural Language Processing) capabilities that turn your usual one-sided conversations into a bi-directional engagement. Qubriux allows you to create a survey, send it and track the responses to understand how your brand, your brand communication, products, and customer service are being perceived by customers. All the surveys that are sent to the customers, can be viewed under ‘Survey List’ on the Survey main screen. Each Survey in Survey List has 4 data points associated with it: Survey Name Type of the Survey: A Survey can be sent as Instant, Periodic (If you wish to check with your customers on a regular interval), and Order Delivered (Survey will be sent after order is delivered) Date of creation of Survey Status of the Survey: A Survey can be in an ‘Active or Ended’ state. Ended: means the Survey has been sent to the intended audience and won’t be sent further Active: means there is a recurrence set for this Survey and it will be sent again as per the configuration. You can also quickly toggle a survey on or off and update a survey’s schedule Clicking on individual Surveys Names in the Survey List brings analytics associated with the Survey on the right half of the screen. You can see: Average Sentiment Score: Based on the customer feedback, the NLP engine churns out how your store is being perceived and tells the average sentiment score by indicating whether it is Positive, Negative, or Neutral Net Promoter Score: This gives you a quick view of your customers who are Promoters, Passives, and Detractors. By analyzing these you can create campaigns and offers to target customers from each segment and maximize your earnings Latest Feedback: You will see a snapshot of some of the most recent feedback from your customers. This will give you a quick view of what your customers are thinking about your brand and products recently Dashboard: The dashboard is cumulative of all the surveys and it tells you about the perception of the store as a whole Net Promoter Score: NPS takes into consideration the feedback from the customers and translates it into promoters, detractors, and passives. You can see the changes in the proportion of these in form of visual representation for the last 6 months. Feedback Analysis: ‘Feedback Analysis’ is a key differentiating feature of Qubriux which uses the power of NLP, and allows Qubriux users to understand the sentiments and feedback of customers to engage with them proactively. This feature ensures that customer engagement is not a one-way street and helps in closing the loop with actionable insights and quick responses to customer feedback through the Survey Alerts widget on the Home Screen Click Here. In this section, you get a graphical view of customer sentiments from their feedback and responses to your surveys. This enables you to get a sense of your customer's perceptions and sentiments towards your brand or products or services across a period of time. Feedback Analysis allows you to categorize the feedbacks into Customer Service, Quality, and Rest of the common uncategorized feedbacks. What you can expect under these categories: The number of people talking about the category Sentiment associated with each category Related sub-topics within a category. For ex. Quality is the topic and within quality, people can be talking about Service specifically. How to Create a Survey? Creating a Survey in Qubriux is pretty easy.
